# False Positive Testing Strategy

## Objective

Validate Forseti 461's charter enforcement accuracy by testing with deliberately crafted false positive scenarios via a Discord integration.

## Planned Approach

1. **N8N Discord Integration** - Connect a dedicated Discord channel to N8N workflows
2. **Test Channel** - Citizens and team members submit test contributions through Discord
3. **Forseti Evaluation** - Each message is processed by Forseti for charter validation
4. **Feedback Loop** - Results are posted back to Discord for immediate review

## Status

This feature is planned but not yet implemented. See the [N8N workflows documentation](../../workflows/n8n-github-integration.md) for current integration capabilities.
