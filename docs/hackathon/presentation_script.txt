This is Ò Capistaine — the first school for civic AI.  
In December we opened a citizen contribution repo for town in Brittany.
It needed student agents to handle moderation — so we started teaching them how to behave.
Imagine Dead Poets Society… but in 2026 The students are AI agents.

Audierne is at a crossroads.  
Polarized meetings. Tense debates.  
Millions needed for the school — subsidies disappearing.  
Almost no births, many second homes… fear of becoming a museum town.  
Democracy is stuck.  
People want facts, respect, and clear answers — not more noise.

So we asked a question:  
Can we give AI agents the spirit of Dead Poets Society?  
We treat them like students in Keating’s class.  
We teach them grounding, humility, respect… and independence.  
Not fast answers — real civic skills that calm instead of inflame.

We built a continuous improvement loop.  
Observe real content.  
Test the agents.  
Analyse every trace with Opik.  
Fix the prompts.  
Optimize — every day.  
This is how agents learn to improve, fast and cheaply.

Daily work with Opik gave us strong results.  
Charter conformity: from 20% to 95%.  
Classification into 7 categories: from 12% to 90%.  
Anonymization protects privacy.  
Hallucinations blocked — everything grounded.  
Agents now learn truth… politeness… nuance."

Let’s watch Forseti461 in action.  
A citizen submits an idea.  
Forseti checks the charter.  
One click — it adds the 'charter conform' label and updates our GitHub repo.  
Grounded. Traceable. Respectful.  
The first real brick for civic automation.

This is more than a prototype.  
It reduces polarization in small towns.  
It builds trust through transparency.  
And it scales — future agents will surface the best ideas while respecting budgets and rules.

What did we learn?  
Observability is essential.  
Ship good enough now — not perfect later.  
Civic tech needs humans — agents only amplify participation.  
Thank you.  
Let’s raise civic AI agents that help Audierne seize the day.  
Carpe diem.
