# TRIZ Methodology for Participatory Democracy

## Introduction

TRIZ (Russian: Теория Решения Изобретательских Задач, "Theory of Inventive Problem Solving") is a systematic methodology for innovation and creative problem-solving. Originally developed for engineering challenges, we adapt it here for resolving contradictions in participatory democracy and public policy.

## Core Philosophy

### The TRIZ Worldview

1. **Contradictions are the source of problems**
   - Every significant problem contains a contradiction
   - Solving the contradiction = solving the problem

2. **Contradictions can be resolved, not just traded off**
   - Traditional thinking: compromise (improve A by sacrificing B)
   - TRIZ thinking: transcend (improve A AND preserve B)

3. **Innovation patterns are repeatable**
   - Most inventive solutions follow recognizable patterns
   - These patterns can be learned and applied systematically

### The Ideal Final Result (IFR)

> "The ideal system is one that doesn't exist, but its function is performed."

This means:
- Maximum benefit with minimum resources
- The problem solves itself
- No trade-offs, no side effects

## Types of Contradictions

### Technical Contradictions

**Definition:** Improving one aspect of a system leads to deterioration of another aspect.

```
IF we [action to improve Parameter A]
THEN [Parameter A improves]
BUT [Parameter B deteriorates]
```

**Examples in Democracy:**

| Improvement | Deterioration |
|-------------|--------------|
| Increase public participation | Increase decision-making time |
| Preserve heritage buildings | Limit urban development |
| More transparency | Privacy concerns |

### Physical Contradictions

**Definition:** A single element must simultaneously have opposite properties.

```
Element X must be [Property A] to achieve [Function 1]
AND
Element X must be [NOT Property A] to achieve [Function 2]
```

**Examples:**

| Element | Must be... | And also... |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Participation | Anonymous (honest) | Identified (accountable) |
| Policy | Flexible (adaptive) | Consistent (fair) |
| Meeting | Long (thorough) | Short (efficient) |

### Resolving Physical Contradictions

TRIZ offers four separation principles:

1. **Separation in Time** - Property A at time T1, Property B at time T2
2. **Separation in Space** - Property A in location L1, Property B in location L2
3. **Separation in Scale** - Property A at macro level, Property B at micro level
4. **Separation by Condition** - Property A under condition C1, Property B under condition C2

## Application to Audierne2026

### Key Contradiction Categories

#### 1. Resource Constraint vs. Ambition

**Keywords:** budget, coût, financement, moyens, ressources

**Resolution strategies:**
- Phased implementation plans
- Resource-sharing between projects
- Volunteer and community contributions
- Multi-purpose investments

#### 2. Participation vs. Efficiency

**Keywords:** consultation, participation, rapidité, efficacité, délai

**Resolution strategies:**
- Ongoing input rather than one-time consultations
- Parallel working groups
- Digital tools for processing
- Reuse successful formats

#### 3. Preservation vs. Development

**Keywords:** patrimoine, préservation, développement, modernisation

**Resolution strategies:**
- Heritage as development asset
- Adaptive reuse of buildings
- Modern within historic shell
- Different rules for different zones

#### 4. Individual vs. Collective

**Keywords:** individuel, collectif, communauté, personnel

**Resolution strategies:**
- Clear boundaries between domains
- Opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- Cooperative ownership models
- Mixed public-private solutions

#### 5. Local vs. External

**Keywords:** local, extérieur, tourisme, habitants, résidents

**Resolution strategies:**
- Seasonal differentiation
- Resident priority in key areas
- Flexible policies by context
- Different layers of access
