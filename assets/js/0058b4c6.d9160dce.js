Inspired by examples like the IssyGPT chatbot in Issy-les-Moulineaux (answering citizen questions 24/7 on local projects) or participatory dashboards in Toulouse (with AI to visualize budget progress), here is a concrete, achievable plan adapted for a small municipality like Audierne (low-cost, open source).","sidebar":"audierne2026Sidebar"},"audierne2026/transparency-reports":{"id":"audierne2026/transparency-reports","title":"transparency-reports","description":"","sidebar":"audierne2026Sidebar"},"FIRECRAWL_GUIDE":{"id":"FIRECRAWL_GUIDE","title":"Firecrawl Methodology Guide","description":"This guide explains how to use the Firecrawl infrastructure to collect and organize municipal documents from the Audierne website."},"hackathon/encode-hackathon":{"id":"hackathon/encode-hackathon","title":"letter of intention","description":"Project name"},"methods/separation-of-concerns":{"id":"methods/separation-of-concerns","title":"Separation of Concerns","description":"Modular design for workflows and code organization","sidebar":"methodsSidebar"},"methods/theory-of-constraints":{"id":"methods/theory-of-constraints","title":"Theory of Constraints","description":"Managing budget and resource constraints in civic projects","sidebar":"methodsSidebar"},"methods/triz":{"id":"methods/triz","title":"TRIZ Methodology","description":"Theory of Inventive Problem Solving for participatory democracy","sidebar":"methodsSidebar"},"QUICKSTART":{"id":"QUICKSTART","title":"Firecrawl Quick Reference","description":"\ud83d\ude80 One-Time Setup"},"usage/faq":{"id":"usage/faq","title":"Frequent asked questions","description":"","sidebar":"usageSidebar"},"usage/getting-started":{"id":"usage/getting-started","title":"Getting started","description":"","sidebar":"usageSidebar"},"usage/troubleshooting":{"id":"usage/troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","description":"","sidebar":"usageSidebar"},"workflows/consolidation":{"id":"workflows/consolidation","title":"Consolidation Workflow","description":"Weekly consolidation of citizen contributions","sidebar":"workflowsSidebar"},"workflows/contribution-charter":{"id":"workflows/contribution-charter","title":"Contribution Charter","description":"Governance rules for citizen participation","sidebar":"workflowsSidebar"},"workflows/firecrawl":{"id":"workflows/firecrawl","title":"Firecrawl Workflow","description":"Web scraping workflow for municipal documents","sidebar":"workflowsSidebar"},"workflows/n8n_integrations/Participons-List-Issues":{"id":"workflows/n8n_integrations/Participons-List-Issues","title":"Participons - List Issues","description":"Workflow ID: sRidwFGSiKYfYwEJ"},"workflows/n8n-github-integration":{"id":"workflows/n8n-github-integration","title":"Integration of the N8N server to allow github actions","description":"n8n allows to integrate external services like github - email - discord","sidebar":"workflowsSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
