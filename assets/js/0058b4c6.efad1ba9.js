Inspired by examples like the IssyGPT chatbot in Issy-les-Moulineaux (answering citizen questions 24/7 on local projects) or participatory dashboards in Toulouse (with AI to visualize budget progress), here is a concrete, achievable plan adapted for a small municipality like Audierne (low-cost, open source).","sidebar":"audierne2026Sidebar"},"audierne2026/transparency-reports":{"id":"audierne2026/transparency-reports","title":"transparency-reports","description":"","sidebar":"audierne2026Sidebar"},"FIRECRAWL_GUIDE":{"id":"FIRECRAWL_GUIDE","title":"FIRECRAWL_GUIDE","description":"DEPRECATED: This document has been consolidated.
