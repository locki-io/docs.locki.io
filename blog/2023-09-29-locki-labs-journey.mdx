# Locki: A Journey Through Blockchain Innovation

Locki started as a vision during the **Encode MultiversX Hackathon in October 2023**, with the ambitious goal of creating a decentralized platform for minting, viewing, and interacting with 3D Data NFTs using the Itheum protocol.

## Current Status

:::info Project Status

Locki dApp is currently in **alpha phase** on MultiversX devnet, and has been supported by the **xPand Itheum program**.

:::

The platform has evolved significantly since its inception, now featuring:

- **3D Data NFT minting and visualization** using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **AI-powered chat assistant** for Blender Python scripting guidance
- **Whitelist management system** for controlled access
- **Integration with MultiversX wallets** including xAlias support

## The Challenge of Collecting RAG Data and Intellectual Property

One of the most significant hurdles we've encountered is **building a quality dataset for our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** while respecting intellectual property rights.

### The IP Dilemma

Creating an effective AI assistant for 3D modeling and Blender scripting requires extensive training data:

- **Documentation licensing**: Much of the best Blender documentation exists under various licenses that complicate commercial use
- **Community content**: Forum posts, tutorials, and Stack Exchange answers have complex attribution requirements
- **Proprietary scripts**: Many advanced Blender scripts are commercial products with restrictive licenses
- **Version fragmentation**: Blender's rapid release cycle means documentation quickly becomes outdated

### Our Approach

We've had to carefully curate our data sources, focusing on:

1. **Open-source documentation** with permissive licenses
2. **Original content creation** to fill knowledge gaps
3. **User-generated content** with explicit consent
4. **Partnerships** with content creators in the Blender ecosystem

The Locki companion AI feature is currently **on pause** while we navigate these data collection challenges and ensure full compliance with IP rights.

## Technical Challenges: The Blockchain Moving Target

Perhaps the most demanding aspect of maintaining Locki has been keeping pace with the **rapid evolution of blockchain infrastructure**.

### SDK Version Churn

The MultiversX ecosystem has undergone substantial changes:

```json
// Our current dependency snapshot
"@multiversx/sdk-core": "12.18.0",
"@multiversx/sdk-dapp": "2.28.7",
"@multiversx/sdk-network-providers": "2.3.0",
"@itheum/sdk-mx-data-nft": "2.7.0-beta.4"
```

Each major version brings:

- **Breaking API changes** requiring code refactoring
- **New authentication patterns** (we've integrated xAlias, native auth tokens)
- **Smart contract interface updates** affecting our ABI integrations
- **Wallet provider deprecations** forcing migration to new connection methods

### Specific Challenges We've Faced

1. **SSR Compatibility**: Next.js App Router with blockchain SDKs requires careful dynamic imports to avoid server-side rendering issues

2. **Transaction Handling**: The move from legacy transaction signing to the new `signAndSendTransactions` utility required substantial refactoring

3. **Smart Contract ABIs**: Contract updates on devnet mean our local ABIs must be continuously synchronized

4. **Network Provider Changes**: API endpoint changes and rate limiting adjustments have required multiple backend adaptations

### The Maintenance Burden

```
Recent commits reflecting ongoing maintenance:
- "Upgrade: Status locki companion"
- "fix vulnerabilities"
- "Fixed build issues"
- "Fixes smart contract dependencies and code refactoring"
```

Each vulnerability fix in upstream dependencies cascades through our codebase. The security-conscious nature of blockchain applications means we cannot defer these updates.

## Lessons Learned

### For Blockchain Developers

1. **Abstract your SDK interactions**: Create wrapper classes (like our `baseSmartContract.ts`) to isolate breaking changes
2. **Pin versions carefully**: Use exact versions in production, but test against latest regularly
3. **Monitor ecosystem announcements**: Join Discord channels and follow GitHub releases
4. **Build with deprecation in mind**: What works today may be obsolete in 6 months

### For AI/RAG Builders

1. **Document your data sources**: Track provenance from day one
2. **Build consent mechanisms**: Make it easy for users to contribute data with clear licensing
3. **Plan for re-training**: Your model will need updates as source material evolves
4. **Consider synthetic data**: Generate training examples where real data is restricted

## What's Next for Locki

Despite these challenges, we remain committed to the vision:

- **Mainnet deployment** once alpha testing is complete
- **Enhanced 3D NFT features** with improved GLTF/GLB support
- **Expanded AI capabilities** with properly licensed training data
- **Community governance** for whitelist and platform decisions
