### Project Overview & Vision

- The core idea is building an **AI-powered civic transparency platform** focused on local democracy, citizen engagement, and real-world issues (starting with inspiration from India, but with potential global scalability).
- Goal: Create a standardized, bullshit-free alternative to Twitter/X discussions for civic topics — avoiding noise and enabling structured transparency for citizens, investors, and "democracy islands" (e.g., places like Audierne).
- It's tied to the **"Commit to Change" AI Agents Hackathon** (powered by Opik / Comet), running ~4 weeks starting mid-January 2026, with categories like Community Impact.

### Hackathon Focus & Judging Criteria Emphasis

- Heavy emphasis on **Opik integration** for observability, evaluation, metrics, dashboards, experiment tracking, and improving LLM/agent quality.
- Key criteria to nail: Functionality, real-world relevance (New Year’s/civic goals), effective LLM/agent use, robust evaluation/monitoring, and deep Opik workflow integration (not just fluff).
- Plan: Automate Opik feedback into the platform for a "virtuous circle" of optimization. Showcase Opik at every stage (dev workflow, runtime monitoring, etc.).
- Strategy: Prioritize smooth, meaningful Opik use → even if some parts feel like "fluff," lean into it for judging scores.

### Team & Collaboration Setup

- You created/invited Meher to the project using team join code: **0e10f89d** (valid until Jan 17, 2026).
- Repo: **Ocapistaine** (on GitHub/GitLab?) — you updated it with:
  - Clear license
  - Collaboration addendum / agreements
  - Docusaurus as submodule for docs
  - Project board with tasks (including Opik-specific ones)
- You proposed a fair structure for handling prize money / motivation (Meher called it "very clean" and liked it).
- Meher was pending → accepted invite; you both coordinated joining the hackathon portal/team.
- Another collaborator (Vic) self-assigned tasks.
- You shared the kickoff doc: https://docs.locki.io/blog/ocapistaine-hackathon-kickoff (titled "Ò Capistaine Kick-off | AI-Powered Civic Transparency for Local Democracy").

### Monetization & Long-Term Ideas

- You have ideas for monetizing / turning it into a full startup (trust-based, you'll share more).
- Potential global expansion discussed, but start focused (e.g., India as strong testbed).
- References to past hackathon success (you + Satish, 4th place with on-chain 3D objects + AI chatbot).
- Avoid overkill like Decidim platforms — keep it practical and thrilling.

### Recent Status & Next Steps

- Meher was occasionally busy/catching up (dinner, out, etc.) but engaged.
- As of last messages (~Jan 15–16, 2026):
  - Everyone's in the team/repo.
  - Ready to start **coding** (both excited: "tickles in fingers").
  - Emphasis on transparent task assignment ("tell what we do and do what we tell").
  - Call happened in Ocapistaine channel.
  - Brainstorming better Opik showcases ongoing.

**Overall vibe**: Enthusiastic, trusting partnership ("I trust you!"). You're leading repo/docs/setup/strategy; Meher is on board, catching up, and eager to code + highlight Opik. Project is now properly set up and ready to build — focus on delivering a functional, Opik-heavy prototype for the hackathon deadline.
