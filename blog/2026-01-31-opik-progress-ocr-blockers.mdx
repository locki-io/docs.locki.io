Quick catch-up between Johnny (@jnxmas) and Victor (@zcbtvag) covering Opik integration progress and OCR pipeline challenges.

## Summary

Johnny showcased recent progress on **Opik prompt optimization**. A new architecture is in place where prompts are no longer hardcoded but managed via an **Opik Prompt Library**. The "Charter Validation" prompt has already been optimized using this system.

A new **mock-up feature** can automatically generate contributions (even with violations) from existing meeting reports. The goal is to create a robust dataset to test and improve the validation agent. However, this auto-generation currently produces repetitive content - a challenge that will need addressing by identifying and aggregating duplicate contributions.

Victor reported working on the **PDF processing pipeline**, specifically tackling PDFs that are images and require OCR. This has been a blocker, as several libraries have proven difficult to install. Text-based PDF extraction is working fine.

Johnny clarified that the highest priority documents for OCR are the **"Gwaien" municipal magazines** - they contain rich, precise historical data on the municipality's actions over the past six years, and their OCR should be relatively straightforward compared to other documents.

## Alignment & Risk Assessment

| Area                      | Status      | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alignment**             | Good        | Team aligned on priorities: contribution processing + data pipeline for RAG      |
| **Risk: OCR Blocker**     | High        | Installation/implementation issues slowing data ingestion                        |
| **Risk: Repetitive Data** | Medium      | Auto-generated contributions could create biased dataset                         |
| **Mitigation**            | In Progress | Focus OCR on high-value "Gwaien" docs first; explore antigravity with Gemini Pro |

## Branch Status

- **Victor:** `feature/contribution-refinement`
- **Johnny:** `feature/crawling-migration`
- **Action:** Coordinate merge before next call

## Action Plan & Tasks

### 1. OCR Pipeline (Priority: High)

- **Task:** Implement OCR for "Gwaien" PDF documents
  - **Owner:** @zcbtvag (Victor)
  - **Description:** Prioritize implementing a working OCR solution for the "Gwaien" magazine PDFs in the `ext_data/` directory. Explore different libraries or the antigravity agent.
  - **Deadline:** Next call
  - **Success Criteria:** Text successfully extracted from image-based "Gwaien" PDFs.

### 2. Code Sharing & Tooling

- **Task:** Push antigravity agent code
  - **Owner:** @jnxmas (Johnny)
  - **Description:** Push changes containing antigravity agent experiments so Victor can explore it as a potential tool for OCR implementation.
  - **Deadline:** ASAP
  - **Success Criteria:** Victor can access and run the new agent code locally.

### 3. Branch Integration

- **Task:** Merge feature branches
  - **Owner:** @zcbtvag & @jnxmas
  - **Description:** Coordinate to merge `feature/contribution-refinement` and `feature/crawling-migration` branches.
  - **Deadline:** Next call
  - **Success Criteria:** Single unified branch without conflicts.

### 4. Data Quality

- **Task:** Develop duplicate detection strategy
  - **Owner:** @jnxmas (Johnny)
  - **Description:** Design a method to identify when a new contribution is a duplicate or highly similar to an existing one. Critical for managing auto-generation output and real citizen contributions.
  - **Deadline:** Next call
  - **Success Criteria:** Clear plan or PoC documented for identifying duplicate contributions.

| -------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Data Ingestion (Firecrawl/OCR)         | Blocked | OCR implementation issues                     |
| Contribution Automation (Email-GitHub) | Done    | Core workflow established                     |
| Opik Integration & Prompt Tuning       | Done    | New prompt library + optimization experiments |
| RAG Chatbot                            | Blocked | Waiting on data ingestion                     |

**Next Milestone:** Unblock OCR pipeline to begin ingesting all PDF data for the RAG system.
