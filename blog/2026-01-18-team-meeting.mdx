## Political & Community Engagement Progress

**Achievements**:

- **Outgoing mayor**: Positive signal at New Year's event - mentioned "new paradigm in politics"
- **Email follow-up**: Mayor acknowledged project email (10+ days prior), interested in discussing Audierne2026
- **Electoral lists**: 3 of 4 lists contacted, very positive responses
- **Remaining**: 1 list still to contact (before Jan 31)
  **Current Challenge**:
- **Low citizen engagement**: Contributions/discussions system seeing minimal activity ("it's a bit too much right now")
- **Content workflow**: Issues validated → transferred to discussions → posted on website after community review
- **Validation stages**: Charter compliance + Contextualization (innovative agent finding solutions)
  **Strategic Shift**: Team needs to move from outreach to coding and delivery.

## Technical Architecture - Stack Decisions Finalized

### Layer Structure (Bottom-Up ETL Pattern)

**1. External Services Layer**

- **Firecrawl API**: Primary web scraping/crawling service
- **Status**: Victor progressing, PR open, completion target Wednesday (before travel)
- **Blocker**: Pagination settings need tuning (tested with `max_pages=10`, returned only 1 page)
- **Priority source**: Délibérations du conseil municipal (municipal council deliberations)
  **2. Data Access Layer**
- **Vector Store**: Confirmed standard VectorStore approach (all team members familiar)
- **Embeddings Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: NOMIC model (Sentence Transformer) - Guru has experience
  - **Backup/Failsafe**: Mistral Studio - French language optimization + potential local sponsorship
- **Crawl Tracking Database**: SQL Lite/SQL Model chosen
  - Metadata: Crawl status, RAG inclusion, content category
  - SQL Model benefits: Type safety (Python → SQL columns), FastAPI/Pydantic compatibility, PostgreSQL support
  - Owner: [jnxmas] will build during Victor's absence
    **3. Business Logic Layer**
    **Agent 1: Charter Validation Agent** (PRIORITY)
- **Purpose**: Auto-validate citizen contributions against charter rules
- **Checks**: Respectful language, no personal naming, constructive content
- **Functionality**: Binary (green/red) conformance + auto-correct miscategorized submissions (7 categories)
- **Tech Stack**: Gemini (primary), Ollama (testing), Opik evaluation/tracing
- **Workflow**: Reads `audierne2026` repo issues → labels/updates in `ocapistaine` repo
- **Owner**: Guru (@GurmeherSingh)
- **Status**: Not started (blocked by Opik access + N8N deployment)
  **Agent 2: RAG Agent / Citizen Q&A Chatbot**
- **Purpose**: Answer citizen questions with neutral, contextual responses, cross-reference municipal programs
- **Requirements**: No hallucinations (Opik guardrails), source attribution, French language
- **Approach**: Start with available data, iterate as crawling progresses
- **Owner**: Guru (@GurmeherSingh)
- **Status**: Starting development, update expected in 1-2 days
- **Dependencies**: VectorStore populated, Charter agent outputs (optional)
  **Agent 3: Search Agent** (CONDITIONAL)
- **Decision**: Pending RAG completeness assessment
- **Logic**: If RAG sufficient → search agent unnecessary; if RAG insufficient → search agent as fallback
- **Status**: On hold pending RAG testing
  **Chat Service** (Already Working)
- **Functionality**: Multi-turn conversations with thread management (UUID per user)
- **Providers**: OpenAI, Ollama (Mistral, DeepSeek tested locally), Perplexity, Gemini
- **Features**: System message config, prompt engineering, thread history persistence, strategy selection (Charter mode, Q&A mode, etc.)
- **Opik Integration**: Full tracing via `workflow_chat` class
  **Document Service** (To Be Defined)
- **Proposed Purpose**:
  - Query documentation/source information
  - Scheduled re-crawling (detect new docs since last crawl)
  - Document categorization + metadata tagging
  - Change detection (compare current vs. new crawls, decide RAG updates)
- **Open Question**: How does this differ from Chat Service? (Clarified: Document = search/crawl management; Chat = conversational interface)
- **Status**: Requirements to be defined collaboratively
  **4. Application Layer**
- **Streamlit**: Primary presentation interface
- **FastAPI**: Routing layer
- **Debug Scripts**: One-click full stack launch (UV cone + Streamlit app automation)
- **Hot Reload**: Code modifications work without restart
- **Future**: Redis integration for scheduler + task memory persistence
  **5. External Orchestration Layer**
- **N8N**: Self-hosted Docker deployment on Contabo server (viety.loki.io)
- **Status**: ~2 hours from completion (as of last meeting)
- **Workflows**:
  - Pull issues from `audierne2026` GitHub repo
  - Trigger charter validation agent
  - Push validated/labeled issues back to repo
  - Modify Jekyll website content
  - Provide API endpoint for agent testing
- **Multi-project approach**: Separate workflows per project on shared dashboard
- **Future**: Pull data from Opik Cloud back into app (feedback loop via N8N API)
  **Supporting Infrastructure**:
- **APScheduler (cron-based)**: Time-based tasks (daily/weekly crawl updates, GitHub monitoring, Charter violation checks)
- **Opik**: Evaluation, tracing, prompt management (future), hallucination detection, metrics/dashboards
- **Poetry**: Dependency management (NOT pip) for library compatibility

---

## Opik Integration Strategy - MAXIMIZE USAGE

**Team Consensus**: "Maximize Opik usage at every opportunity" - it's the hackathon focus.
**Dashboard Setup Decisions**:

- **Environment**: Start with Opik Dev, migrate to Prod when ready
- **Dashboard Approach**: Single unified dashboard to monitor all agents (avoid complexity of separate dashboards per agent)
- **API Keys**: Likely one project with multiple keys for per-developer usage tracking
- **Access**:
  - [jnxmas] has access to `ocapistaine-dev` dashboard
  - Need to grant Guru and Victor access
  - Guru has existing Opik account (needs to share user ID/Discord username)
  - Victor's Opik status: Not confirmed
    **Integration Points**:
- Charter validation agent: Trace every decision, verify adherence to charter rules
- RAG agent: Hallucination prevention, prompt evaluation, guardrails
- N8N workflows: Plug into Opik for agent activity reporting
- Chat service: Already using Opik tracing via `workflow_chat` class
- Prompt management: Start hardcoded, potentially migrate to Opik prompt library later
- Evaluation judge: Verify LLM adherence to prompts
  **Team Familiarity**:
- Platform exploration phase: Team has not yet fully explored Opik capabilities
- Reference materials: Git examples available for implementation patterns
- Action needed: All team members familiarize with Opik features (dashboards, prompt library, evaluation)

---

## LLM Provider Strategy - Multi-Provider Approach

**Confirmed Providers**:

1. **Gemini**: Sponsored/free option (primary for Charter agent)
2. **Ollama**: Completely free (local testing) - Mistral, DeepSeek tested
3. **Mistral**: French language optimization + potential sponsorship target (French govt/local alignment, political risk mitigation)
4. **OpenAI**: Already working in Chat service
5. **Perplexity**: Available option
   **Strategic Rationale**:

- **French language**: Critical for citizen-facing content - Mistral chosen for optimization
- **Political optics**: Using French LLM provider avoids criticism of not supporting French solutions
- **Cost management**: Prioritize free/sponsored options (Gemini, Ollama)
- **Failsafe approach**: NOMIC primary + Mistral backup = "two tracks maximum" ([jnxmas]'s preference given 4-week timeline)

---

## Development Workflow & Version Control

**Git Strategy**:

- **Protected branch**: `dev` branch - no direct pushes
- **Feature branches**: Mandatory for all work
- **PR workflow**: Victor successfully resolved upstream branch issue, has open PR ready for review
- **Review process**: [jnxmas] reviews and merges into `dev`
  **Dependency Management**:
- **Poetry ONLY**: NOT pip - ensures library compatibility
- **Command**: `poetry add `
- **Action**: Victor + Guru ensure local environments use Poetry
  **Documentation**:
- **Docusaurus blog**: All meeting summaries posted to `blog/` for async collaboration + AI context (Cursor/Claude code context)
- **GitHub tasks**: Self-assignment encouraged, commenting for async feedback
- **Task board**: 3 tasks "In Progress" with all three team members assigned

## Alignment Confirmations & Strategic Notes

**✅ Strong Alignments**:

- Opik-first approach aligns perfectly with hackathon goals
- Multi-provider LLM strategy provides resilience and cost optimization
- French language focus (Mistral) addresses political optics and user needs
- Modular ETL architecture enables swapping components without rewrites
- Team expertise (NOMIC, Streamlit, VectorStore) matches stack decisions
- Task ownership clear and distributed well (Guru = agents, Victor = crawling, [jnxmas] = infrastructure/orchestration)
  **⚠️ Potential Misalignments**:
- **Timeline vs. scope**: 4 weeks for full pipeline (crawling + OCR + RAG + Charter agent + chatbot + Opik showcase) is aggressive
  - **Mitigation**: Limit to "two tracks" (NOMIC primary, Mistral backup), prioritize Charter agent + basic RAG over perfect Search Agent
- **Citizen engagement vs. effort**: Low contribution volume may not justify complex validation workflow
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on chatbot quality (broader citizen reach) over contribution automation
- **Team availability gaps**: Victor's Thu-Sun absence, Guru's jet lag, [jnxmas]'s teaching commitment
  - **Mitigation**: Strong async collaboration (recordings, blog summaries, GitHub comments), clear handoffs
    **🔍 Clarifications Needed**:
- **Document Service vs. Chat Service**: Distinction still fuzzy (addressed as: Document = search/crawl management; Chat = conversational interface, but needs formal requirements doc)
- **Search Agent necessity**: Conditional decision pending RAG testing (good pragmatic approach)
- **Opik dashboard structure**: Single unified dashboard confirmed, but team needs to explore platform features to maximize value
  **📈 Recommended Focus Areas**:

1. **This week**: Charter agent + RAG agent + Firecrawl completion + Opik access = critical path
2. **Next week**: OCR testing + Document Service definition + crawl tracking DB = data pipeline completion
3. **Week 3-4**: Integration, testing, French language validation, Opik showcase polish, citizen-facing chatbot MVP

## Documentation & Knowledge Management

**Current Practices** (Strong):

- ✅ Docusaurus blog: Meeting summaries posted to `blog/` for async collaboration
- ✅ GitHub tasks: Self-assignment, commenting for feedback
- ✅ Task board: 3 tasks "In Progress" with assignments
- ✅ Architecture blog post: Created for team review + AI context (Cursor/Claude)
- ✅ Meeting recordings: Shared for async team members (Guru)
- ✅ "Tell what we do and do what we tell": Commitment tracking across conversations
  **Improvements Suggested**:
- 📝 Document Opik integration patterns as you build (hackathon showcase value)
- 📝 Create crawl tracking DB schema diagram (avoid ambiguity)
- 📝 Formalize Document Service requirements doc (per Task 12)
- 📝 Keep citizen-facing deliverable timeline visible (dashboard/Gantt chart)
- 📝 Document OCR library comparison results (Task 10)

## Next Sync Meeting Agenda (Suggested)

1. **N8N + Opik access**: Confirm both unblocked ([jnxmas] updates)
2. **Firecrawl PR status**: Review and merge if ready (Victor + [jnxmas])
3. **Charter agent progress**: Demo initial prototype, discuss Opik traces (Guru)
4. **RAG agent update**: Share approach, blockers, timeline (Guru)
5. **Crawl tracking DB**: Review schema design ([jnxmas])
6. **Document Service requirements**: Collaborative definition session (All)
7. **Task board review**: Close completed tasks, reprioritize open items (All)
8. **Opik showcase strategy**: What metrics/traces will impress hackathon judges? (All)

## Status Dashboard

**Overall Progress**:

- 🟢 **Architecture**: Finalized (VectorStore, NOMIC, Mistral, N8N, Opik strategy confirmed)
- 🟡 **Firecrawl Pipeline**: Victor progressing, PR open, completion target Wed
- 🟡 **N8N Deployment**: ~2 hours from completion (infrastructure blocker)
- 🟡 **Opik Setup**: Account exists, team access pending (need usernames)
- 🔴 **Charter Agent**: Not started (blocked by Opik access + N8N)
- 🟡 **RAG Agent**: Starting development, update expected 1-2 days
- 🔴 **OCR Pipeline**: Blocked on crawling completion
- 🔴 **Crawl Tracking DB**: Design phase
- 🟢 **Team Coordination**: Strong communication, clear roles, async collaboration working
- 🟡 **Political Outreach**: 3/4 lists contacted, positive signals
- 🔴 **Citizen Engagement**: Low contribution volume (UX consideration needed)
- 🟢 **Documentation**: Blog summaries active, recordings shared, task tracking functional
  **Open High-Priority Tasks** (Top 5):

1. **🔴 URGENT**: Complete N8N deployment ([jnxmas], &lt;48h) - blocks agent testing
2. **🔴 URGENT**: Set up Opik team access ([jnxmas], &lt;24h) - blocks Guru's development
3. **🔴 URGENT**: Complete Firecrawl pipeline (Victor, by Wed) - data ingestion dependency
4. **🔴 HIGH**: Build Charter validation agent (Guru, update 1-2 days) - critical path for hackathon
5. **🔴 HIGH**: Build RAG agent with Opik (Guru, update 1-2 days) - citizen-facing deliverable
   **Next Milestones**:

- **Week 1 Goal (by ~Jan 30-31)**: Charter validation agent functional with Opik tracing + Firecrawl pipeline merged + N8N orchestrating GitHub workflows + RAG agent prototype
- **Immediate Blockers**: N8N deployment (&lt;48h), Opik access (&lt;24h), Firecrawl pagination tuning (&lt;3 days)
- **Hackathon Prototype Delivery**: ~mid-February 2026 (2.5 weeks remaining from late Jan)
- **Critical Path**: Crawling → OCR → Vector DB → RAG + Opik → Chatbot MVP → French language validation
  **Team Availability This Week**:
- **Guru**: Available now (jet-lagged but active), development starting
- **Victor**: Intensive Mon-Wed, unavailable Thu-Sun (France travel)
- **[jnxmas]**: Full availability, prioritizing N8N/Opik/testing during Victor's absence
  **Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Timeline tight, first agent not yet live despite approaching contributions deadline, but team aligned and architecture solid. Immediate focus on unblocking N8N + Opik access will shift to 🟢 GREEN if completed within 48h.

---

**Confidence Level**: 🟡 **CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC** - Strong team, solid architecture, clear tasks, but timeline aggressive and first agent not yet live. Success depends on unblocking N8N + Opik access within 48h and Charter agent prototype within 1 week. Victor's Wed deadline and Guru's jet lag are manageable with current plans.
**Recommendation**: Daily async standups (Discord) this week to track Charter agent + Firecrawl progress. Consider lightweight demo/review session Friday to validate week 1 progress before weekend.
